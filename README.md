# MazeSolver
An interactive maze solver that allows the user to solve a maze that is randomly generated using Kruskal's MST Algorithm. Users can also decide to generate a maze that is either vertically or horizontally biased, showing more of the biased direction when generating the maze. To view the solution, user's can decide to choose a breadth first search solution or a depth first search solution. The user instructions can be viewed in the MazeDocumentation.txt file.

Due to the limitations of the course, the source code is only available upon request and instructor's approval.
